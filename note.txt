We can work off of https://www.olympusdao.finance/ as well for the pre-landing page. 

Headers would be 
Our logo + CalmDAO                       FAQs, Twitter Icon, Discord Icon, Medium Icon, Reddit Icon

Link for FAQ: https://eric-choi.gitbook.io/calmdao/
Link for Twitter: https://twitter.com/calmdao66
Link for Discord: https://discord.gg/rXdeVczEbE
Link for Medium: https://medium.com/@calmdao66
Link for Reddit: I'll give you later

Instead of "NEW OlyZaps Zap into...", we can say "Releasing Soon!"
Instead of "The Decentralized Reserve Currency", we can say "The Most Stable Rebase Token in DeFi 2.0"
Instead of "Olympus is building...", we can say "CalmDAO is a decentralized reserve currency protocol of Binance Smart Chain."
On the right side of our message, we want a clear, big, and noticeable text "Join our Discord" with onclick function that goes to our Discord. 

Below those, we'd want the text "Why CalmDAO?"
And then we want "1. Doxxed and Competent Team", "2. Long-Term Growth with Reasonable APY", "3. Focus on Treasury", "4. Tokenomics"

I think this would be good for the first step. I'll check the progress tomorrow morning (my time zone) and give you more instructions. 

Please focus on maintaining the black and gold theme and making the website look professional. Also, please use Typescript and React and write detailed instructions on README so that I can easily follow you. 

Let me know if you have any question working on it.
